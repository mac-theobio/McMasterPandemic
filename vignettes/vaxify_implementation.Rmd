A place to keep notes on expandify implementation (ageify, vaxify) assumptions and future work (instead of relying on disparate FIXMEs).

## Assumptions

### General

* `distribute_counts()` (via `smart_round()`: preferentially fills counts from right to left (e.g. in `expand_state_age`, counts from a specified state will be distributed from older age groups to younger)

### Vaxify

* `expand_state_vax()`: everyone starts in the unvaccinated compartment, regardless of epi status or point in the epidemic.
  * Can we actually already get around this by specifying `make_state(x = vec)`?
* `mk_vaxrates()`: we need to know (or be able to calculate the number of doses per day administered to each subgroup (e.g. age category) of the population.

## To fix/do

* `condense_vax()`: make it work for ageified case (don't condense over age groups)
* `mk_vaxrates()`: check that it works for ageified parameters (specifically the `doses_per_day/params[["N"]]` calculation, since this is a vector divided by a vector)

## Questions (for Ben)

1. I have a choice between handling the calculation of per capita daily vaccination rates as a pre-processing step or in the sim... does it matter for `timepars` or `calibrate` when these rates are calculated?
