\title{calculate only updated force of infection
at present, this is the only state-dependent \emph{per capita} rate
maybe more efficient than modifying & returning the whole matrix}
\usage{
update_foi(state, params, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{named vector of states}

\item{params}{named vector of parameters}

\item{beta}{vector or matrix of transmission rates, where (length(beta) | ncol(beta)) == length(state)}
