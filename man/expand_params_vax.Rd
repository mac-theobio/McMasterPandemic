\arguments{
\item{params}{parameter list (e.g. read in with `read_params()`)}

\item{model_type}{choose either the one-dose or the two-dose model}

\item{vax_doses_per_day}{total number of vaccine doses administered per day}

\item{vax_prop_first_dose}{the proportion of vaccine doses administered per day that are first doses}

\item{vax_efficacy_dose1}{infection-blocking vaccine efficacy for dose 1}

\item{vax_efficacy_dose2}{infection-blocking vaccine efficacy for dose 2}

\item{vax_avg_response_time}{average number of days it takes for a vaccine dose to confer protection for an individual that has never been infected}

\item{vax_avg_response_time_R}{average number of days it takes for a vaccine dose to confer protection for an individual that has previously been infected (e.g. between being dosed and eliciting the protective immune response)}

\item{vax_alpha_dose1}{proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in individuals that have received one dose of the vaccine}

\item{vax_alpha_dose2}{proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in individuals that have received two doses of the vaccine}

\item{vax_mu_dose1}{proportion of infections that are mild (vs. severe) in individuals that have received one dose of the vaccine}

\item{vax_mu_dose2}{proportion of infections that are mild (vs. severe) in individuals that have received two doses of the vaccine}
