We should put our ideas for speeding up the package/calibration here. Additionally, we should estimate the potential payoffs of implementing each idea.
* Use online calibration (estimated 50-75% speedup, from 3-4 hours instead of 7-14 hours). However, we still should do full calibrations once every 2 weeks or so. 
* run calibration on Graham or other supercomputer cluster (extreme speedup especially if given high priority)
* add_updated_vaxrate() copies the entire rate matrix, makes changes to it, then returns the updated rate matrix. Iâ€™m sure we can speed this up using some indexing tricks Ben mentioned in the last meeting. (up to 50% speedup, but most likely less than 25%)
  *   We'd have to think about it carefully, but one **Very** quick way to achieve pass-by-reference semantics in R (rather than the usual copy-on-modify) is to nest the item you want to update in place inside an environment.
* Reimplementing do_step in Rcpp (??? speedup)
* only use regex once, and save the resulting variable positions as an object attribute (estimated 15% speedup)
* replace regexes with startsWith (done, 3% speedup)
* optimize Kronecker product function in vaxify model (done, 5-10% speedup)
* replacing columnwise vector-matrix multiplication with M*v (done, 5-10% speedup)
