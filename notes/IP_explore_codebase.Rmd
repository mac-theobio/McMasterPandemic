I'm using this doc to record notes as I explore MacPan's codebase. Here's a [handy link](https://jozef.io/r916-exploring-r-code-interactively/) with tools for inspecting code in R (really for debugging). I've since discovered the `lookup` package, which contains the aptly-named function `lookup()` that enables one inspect the source code of a specified function, without entering the dubugging workflow (e.g using `debug()` or `debugonce()`). More info on using `lookup` [here](https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/05/14/read-the-source/).

```{r load-libraries, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(McMasterPandemic)
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_bw())
library(cowplot)
library(lookup)
# devtools::install_github("jimhester/lookup")
```

# Load vignette

```{r}
vignette("getting_started", package = "McMasterPandemic")
```

# Model setup

## Load params

```{r}
lookup(read_params)
params1 <- read_params("ICU1.csv")
print(class(params1))
print(head(params1))
```

Params are loaded in as a named vector, where elements can be accessed as follows:

```{r}
print(params1["alpha"])
```

If a description column (`desc_col`) was provided in the original param file (describing the parameter symbols), it will be stored as the `"description"` attribute (a named list where the parameter symbols are the column names):

```{r}
print(head(attr(params1, "description")))
```

There is also a `describe_params()` method that takes `params_pansim` objects and nice table with both parameter values and meanings aggregated:

```{r}
describe_params(params1)
```

Not sure why each column is of type factor (or if this may cause problems down the road...)

## Summarise params

The `summary` method will take the raw parameters and calculate some derived model quantities:

```{r}
lookup(summary)
params1_summary <- summary(params1)
print(params1_summary)
```

In adding age structure, we need to make sure the methods that calculate these derived quantities (`get_r`, `get_R0`, `get_Gbar`) are updated.

```{r}
lookup(get_R0)
get_R0(params1, components=TRUE)
```

There are two methods for `get_R0`: "analytical" and "kernel". The kernel  approach seems flexible (though may require changes to `get_kernel_moments`), while "analytical" is hard-coded.

## Initial conditions

```{r}
lookup(make_state)
state1 <- make_state(params=params1)
```

Will need to update `make_state` by adding a new model type that has the correct list of compartment names for the initial conditions.

# Simulate a model

```{r}
sdate <- "2020-Feb-10"
edate <- "2020-Jun-1"

lookup(run_sim)
res1 <- run_sim(params=params1, state=state1, start_date=sdate, end_date=edate)
summary(res1)
```

Key step seems to be use of `thin()`, for which I cannot find any documentation...
In `thin()` we see a `do.call` on `run_sim_range` with parameters/states declared using an object constructed with `nlist`.

```{r}
#lookup(summary)
summary(res1)
```

```{r}
plot_grid(plot(res1, log=TRUE), ## logarithmic
          plot(res1)) ## linear
```

## Abbreviated call list

When `run_sim` gets called when `has_age(params) == TRUE`, here are roughly the major functions that get run (in order):

```
run_sim
  make_ratemat*
    make_beta*
  run_sim_range
    do_step
      update_ratemat*
        update_foi*
          beta_vec = make_beta*
          foi <- beta_vec %*% state
```
# Time-varying parameters

Here's a base sim with time-varying $\beta$, taken from the getting started vignette:

```{r base_res_time, eval = FALSE}
time_pars <- data.frame(Date=c("2020-04-02"),
                      Symbol=c("beta0"),
                      Relative_value=c(0))
base_res_time <- run_sim(update(base_params,
                                beta0 = 1),
                         base_state,
                         params_timevar = time_pars,
                         start_date = "2020-04-01",
                         end_date = "2020-06-01",
                         ndt = 20,
                         condense=FALSE)

plot(base_res_time, condense=FALSE)
```

The new argument `ndt` determines the number of steps to take between each saved time step and ensures a smoother result (no over-step errors leading to negative states).

In the `run_sim` code, we have the following comment:

```
## FIXME: so far still assuming that params only change foi
## if we change another parameter we will have to recompute M
```

At this point in the code, `M` has been computed, and the `params` list has been updated with the the time-varying parameter (if we hit a switch time). `params` is a copy of the original parameter set (stored as `params0`); `params0` never gets updated. The next command that gets executed is:

```
 resList[[i]] <- drop_last(
                thin(ndt=ndt,
                     do.call(run_sim_range,
                        nlist(params
                            , state
                            , nt=(times[i+1]-times[i]+1)*ndt
                            , dt=dt/ndt
                            , M
                            , use_ode
                            , ratemat_args
                            , step_args
                            , ode_args
                              )))
```

So the original `M` *and* the updated `params` are fed in to `run_sim_range()`, which then calls `do_step()`, where `update_ratemat()` is called with both `params` and `M` before the step is done. In `update_ratemat()`, we have the following line:

```
ratemat[pfun("S","E",ratemat)]  <- update_foi(state,params,make_beta(state,params))
```

(`M` is labelled as `ratemat` in the scope of `update_ratemat()`). So the FOI will be updated in `ratemat` here since `make_beta()` remakes the `beta` value (or vector) from specs in `params`. Hence the note about non-FOI params not being updated with the `params_timevar` functionality.

However, ageified transmission already works within this framework, so `params_timevar` should just work here...

# Calibrate

Looking at `macpan_base/code/breaks_calibrate_vac.R` to better understand the calibration process as it's currently being done. Here's an abbreviated stack:

1. Set up inputs, including province name, population, whether or not to use DE optim, how many cores to use for parallelization, start date, variables (to fit over?), and break dates.
1. Use `fix_pars()` to adjust given parameters based on target values for epidemic moments (e.g. `R0` and mean generation interval length, `Gbar`)
1. Set up `opt_pars` (parameters we want to fit optimally given the observed data): in this script, the three `opt_pars` are `log_beta0`, `rel_beta0`, and `rel_vacc`.
1. Initialize priors (seems to be just `rel_vac`... are there internal defaults for `log_beta0` and `rel_beta0`?)
1. Set up df to store fits depending on start and end date
1. Some setup for Nelder-Mead optimization
1. Run the calibration with `calibrate()`
1. Save results
