# Goal

Simulate an age-structured version of the MacPan model with vaccination to explore various (age-structured) vaccine roll-out strategies.

# What we have

* contact matricies to adjust $\beta_0$ for each pair of age groups

# What we need 

* to verify scaling/normalization of contact matricies (more testing)
* to be able to specify age-specific parameters for hospitalization, ICU admission, death
* age-specific vaccination

# Required updates

## Methods

* `summary.params_pansim`?
  * update `get_r`, `get_R0`, `get_Gbar` to perform the relevant calculations for the age-specific model
* `make_state`
* `run_sim_range` to actually run the simulation (and `nlist`?)
* `summary.pansim` that is age-specific?
* `plot.pansim`

## Other

* Demo param file with age-specific params
* Stochastic simulations

# General to do
- what are the implied parameter units on the entires of the contact matrix?
- read refactor.Rmd
- read Mistry et al to figure out how others are modelling age structure/scaling their matrices
- make param table with units
- add FOI to ageified sim result
- figure out scaling of contact matrix
- try running ageify with non-homogenous parameters across age classes (e.g. delta
- try running ageify with non-homogenous initial state of susceptibles

*make sure to run devtools::check() on the package before pushing changes*
